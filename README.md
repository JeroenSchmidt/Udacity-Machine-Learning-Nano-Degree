# Udacity Machine Learning Nano-degree
This repo contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks which form part of the project assignments for the Udacity [Machine Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009). The notebooks are written in Python 2.7, but should be (mostly) compatible with Python 3.

The source for these projects can be found [here](https://github.com/udacity/machine-learning).
